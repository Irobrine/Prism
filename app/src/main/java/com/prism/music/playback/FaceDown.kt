/**
 * Settings → Playback → "Pause when face down" (1.8.5, off by default): laying the phone screen-down pauses the music;
 * picking it up (screen up again) within five minutes plays on. Prism's first sensor: the accelerometer is listened to
 * only while the setting is on and music is playing (or a face-down pause is under five minutes old, to resume it), and
 * never otherwise, so the switch off costs nothing.
 *
 * The decisions are [FaceDownDetector]'s (pure, unit-tested); this class wires it to the sensor ([SensorTap]) and the
 * player. A pause or play the listener made themselves, or a new queue, ends a face-down pause's claim: it isn't resumed.
 * It does nothing while [Controls.blocked] (casting, a call, Android Auto).
