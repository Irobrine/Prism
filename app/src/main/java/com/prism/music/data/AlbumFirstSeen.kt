/**
 * When Prism first saw each of the account's library albums (1.8.4, D56), for Library → Albums' "Recently added".
 * YouTube's library list comes without dates and in its own order (Prism asks for it without a sort), so the phone
 * keeps its own: every album that's new in a fetched list gets the time of that fetch. The albums of one fetch share
 * one time, so they keep YouTube's order among themselves, as do all the albums that were already there the first
 * time this ran ("seen at upgrade").
 *
 * Times are only dropped when an album is taken out from Prism ([forget]), never because a fetched list lacks it: a
 * list cut short by a failed page would otherwise make old albums new again.
