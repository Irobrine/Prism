 * managed on their own page.
 *
 * What counts plays reads them from the database as it needs them (Replay, the mixes' "anything new?" check by count,
 * Room's lists), so a removal shows there on its own; Home's Replay card keeps its year for a few minutes and is told
 * by the caller. A kept Rewind of a finished year ([RewindStore]) is not written again: finished years stay as they were.
