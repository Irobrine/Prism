/**
 * Prism's own radio: what to play after some songs, picked from the listener's own music (what they've played, liked,
 * downloaded and keep on the phone), with nothing asked of anyone. A song scores for:
 * - being played around the seeds before ([coListen]: the same sitting, a few songs apart) — the strongest sign two
 *   songs belong together for this listener;
 * - the seed's artist, and its genre;
 * - keys that blend (when DJ mode has read both);
 * - how much the listener likes it ([affinity], 0..1).
 * The most recent seed counts most. Picks never run the same artist twice in a row, and take at most [PER_ARTIST]
 * songs by anyone.
