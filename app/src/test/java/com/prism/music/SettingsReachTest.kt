/**
 * 1.8.4, principle 8 of the settings rules ("nothing goes missing", plan §2.1, §2.9, §2.11): **every stored setting has
 * a home.** For every key in `Settings.kt` exactly one of these holds:
 *
 * - a page of Settings writes it (the root, one of the 17 pages, or a screen one of them links to: Customize Home,
 *   Screen backgrounds, the Equalizer), or
 * - it is on [allowed], with the reason it has no row.
 *
 * **Nothing here is a copied list of what a page holds.** What a page claims is read from the code: `Settings.kt` says
 * which keys each setter writes, and a page claims the keys of the setters its own files call ([homes]). So the test
 * fails when
 * - a key is added to `Settings.kt` and no page calls its setter (it has no home),
 * - a page drops the control of a key (the key loses its home),
 * - a page starts writing a key that is listed as state, or that another page holds (one place, principle 4).
 *
 * What it cannot see: that the setter is called from a row a listener can reach. Each `<Page>PageTest` works its own
 * rows for that; this test is the net under them, across all pages.
 *
 * A new setting: give it a row on a page of the map (then this passes by itself). Only state that is not a setting
 * goes on [allowed].
