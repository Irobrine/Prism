/**
 * 1.8.4, plan §2.5 on Gestures & buttons: "Gestures anywhere on the player" + "Gestures below the lyrics" → the one row
 * "Gestures work". Two switches are four stored states and the row offers three choices; the player tells all four
 * apart, so the fourth (below the lyrics without anywhere) keeps a face of its own, and is only offered to whoever has
 * it. Every stored state goes to the row and back unchanged: nobody's gestures change by opening the page.
