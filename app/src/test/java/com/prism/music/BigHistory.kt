/**
 * A big listening history for tests that need one (1.8.5): three years of Prism plays (60,000 by default) across ~4,000
 * songs by ~300 artists, plus ~10,000 imported Spotify plays (most matched to those songs, some not, some too short to
 * count). Deterministic: the same [seed] gives the same history. Songs are stored, so joins with `songs` work.
 *
 * Plays lean towards a few favourite songs (as real ones do) and towards the day and evening, so per-hour and per-song
 * numbers aren't flat. Filling takes about 6 s with `@SQLiteMode(NATIVE)` on the test class, about 30 s without.
