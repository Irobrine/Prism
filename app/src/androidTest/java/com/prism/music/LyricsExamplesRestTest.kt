/**
 * The Lyrics page's examples come to rest (Lyrics & Sing since 1.8.4: its pinned sample, and the templates' cards in
 * the Start from sheet, which were cards on the page). In 1.7.9's Android 9 check they played on for as long as the page was open,
 * and since Prism's sweep lays its line out every frame, accessibility was told of a change every 200 ms: the screen
 * never went quiet, so neither a screen reader nor the check's own screen reading could settle there.
 *
 * No Compose test rule here, on purpose: with one, Compose holds the app's never-ending animations still, and the
 * looping examples passed.
